	<div class="full-content">
		<p>
			Foirejo is an online marketplace for all legal products and services under the sun.
			All payments on the platform are made in <a href="https://getmonero.org">Monero</a>,
			a privacy preserving cryptocurrency. There are no fees on the platform, apart from
			the standard transaction fees that are required by the Monero network itself. Also,
			the entire project is free and open source software
			(<a href="https://github.com/MasFlam/foirejo">see the GitHub repo</a>)
			licensed under AGPLv3, which is great because it makes sure the users' software
			freedom is forever preserved, but it also means the project cannot apply for a CCS
			proposal, as the rules state that code written as part of a CCS proposal must be made
			available under a so-called "permissive" license.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ineligibility for a CCS proposal and no platform fees mean that Foirejo developers can only
			be rewarded through donations. If you want to support Foirejo and its development,
			feel free to leave us a tip in Monero:
