# Contributing – Getting Started
If you don't know Quarkus, it's a good idea to start with its
[Getting Started guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started).
If you have experience in similar frameworks, for example Spring, great. It's pretty similar.
The [`quarkus` CLI tool](https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling) is pretty useful,
but you really only need Gradle.
See the [IDE Tooling guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/ide-tooling) for some info on IDE support.

# Rules
- Code style – what's already there is probably enough to see what it should look like.
  Main takeaways are using tabs for indentation and how long lines are split.
  Keep lines 100 or less columns long (assuming a tab is 4 columns).
- The backend is Java 11.
- The website shall use only HTML and CSS, but you don't have to be concerned about supporting some
  archaic versions or Internet Explorer and whatnot. And try not to use bleeding-edge/experimental
  stuff either.
